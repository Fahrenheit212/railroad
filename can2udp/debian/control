Description: M*rklin Control Station 2 (CS2)  Gateway emulator
 This package contains files to emulate the M*rklin CS2 Gateway:
 can2lan transfers CAN frames to UDP and vice versa, and also
 listen on TCP (for M*rklinApp & Software)
 .
 can2lan is working fine with Rocrail and Gleisbox (60113).
 can2lan aims to emulate the CS2 (or more specific the CAN
 gateway of the CS2).
